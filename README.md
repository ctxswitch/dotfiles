# Dotfiles

What started out as simple dotfiles has turned into something quite a bit larger.  I've merged in many package installations and base configurations to set the baseline on new installs of my personal workstations.  Currently there are two seperate modes of executing the targets.  If you run `make` with sudo, it will run through application installs and some global configurations.  If you run `make` as your user, your personnal environment is set up.

## Dependencies

* Curl
* Make
* Git

## Installation

### Global installation and configuation

Install the dependencies, clone the repo, and run the following commands to install applications and perform global configurations:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ctxswitch/dotfiles.git
$ cd dotfiles
$ make update
$ sudo make
```

Log out and then log back in again to pick up new session and group configurations.

### Create or import your signing key

You'll need to either create or import a git signing key to add it to the local configuration.  To create a key run:

```
$ gpg --full-generate-key

```

To import a key:

```
gpg --import /path/to/signing-key.asc
```

Then grab the id for the next section.

```
$ gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG

sec   rsa4096/F0E2C3B4E2BF179D XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

uid                 [ultimate] Rob Lyon (Github signing key) <rob@ctxswitch.com>
ssb   rsa4096/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### Add the local configuration file

Set up some local environment variables to customize the install.  At a minimum create a `.local` file in the dotfiles directory and include your git config information:

```
GIT_USER_NAME="Rob Lyon"
GIT_USER_EMAIL="rob@ctxswitch.com"
GIT_USER_SIGNING_KEY="<paste in the output from the next section>"
```

### Set up your personal environement

```sh
$ make
```

## Notes:

* There is a bootstrap script available that ensure the appropriate dependencies are installed.  There's not much to it and it will only work on Debian variants.  To run it execute the following command:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ctxswitch/dotfiles/master/bootstrap.sh | sudo bash
```

## Targets

The Makefile is broken up into 6 meta-targets:
* `fonts` - Installs the iosevka fonts.
* `terminal` - Installs and configures zsh and pretzo.
* `packages` - Installs general packages with snap and apt.
* `gnome` - Removes the ubuntu styled desktop and customized gnome settings.
* `devtools` - Development and infrastructure tools.
* `languages` - Set up a variety of development languages.

## Variables

There are several environment variables that you can set.  They include:

* `ALTERNATE_RELEASE`: This is an alternate release codename in cases where the sources may not support the latest release.
* `KUBECTL_VERSION`: Version of kubectl to download and install.
* `DOCKER_MACHINE_VERSION`: Version of docker-machine to download and install.
* `VAGRANT_VERSION`: Version of vagrant to download and install.
* `TERRAFORM_VERSION`: Version of terraform to download and install.
* `PACKER_VERSION`: Version of packer to download and install.
* `CHEFDK_VERSION`: Version of ChefDK to download and install.
* `CHEFDK_DEB_REVISION`: The debian revision number for ChefDK, should me 1 in most cases.
* `RUBY_VERSIONS`: A list of ruby versions to install.  Accepts any available version to rbenv: `rbenv install -l`
* `RUBY_GEMS`: A list of gems to install for each version.  Since I use vendoring in most cases, it's usually minimal - as in rake and bundler.
* `GIT_USER_NAME`: Your git username.
* `GIT_USER_EMAIL`: Your git email.
* `GIT_USER_SIGNINGKEY`: Your users git signing key.
